fastgrep
--------
A utility similar to `grep -r ...` but focused on raw speed and utilization of system resources. This tool
is useful for quickly scanning large directories for files containing a specific string.

This is mainly for fun as I already have a similar tool written in Java. I am interested to see how fast
I can get this compared to that one. Right now (and ignoring jvm startup), they are around the same (maybe 
this one is a little faster). I want to see if I can make it noticeable.

##### Much beta, much wow
